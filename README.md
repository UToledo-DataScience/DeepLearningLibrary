# DeepLearningLibrary
Mathematical computations library designed for applications in deep learning.

NOTE: the library is currently not functional. What's currently here is still very heavy in development.

## TODO
- Basic mathematical operations aside from multiplication
- Computation needs a LOT of work to accommodate different shapes
- Gradient framework
- GPU acceleration
- Unit testing
- Styling standards
- Organization e.g. class headers having declarations, class `.cpp`s having definitions
- Better framework around data types
