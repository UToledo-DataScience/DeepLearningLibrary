# NOTE
This branch currently depends on graph-computation.

# DeepLearningLibrary
Mathematical computations library designed for applications in deep learning.

NOTE: the library is currently not functional. What's currently here is still very heavy in development.

## TODO
- Gradient framework
- More comprehensive set of operations
- GPU acceleration
- **Testing framework!**
- Organization e.g. class headers having declarations, class `.cpp`s having definitions
- Better framework around data types

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing, push your changes onto a new branch and make a pull request (PR). List your changes and reasons behind them in your PR and one of the code owners will check it out.

A few notes before making your changes or PR:
- Run valgrind before submitting any changes related to memory management and make sure there are no memory leaks.
- Make sure your naming style is consistent with what's already in the library.
- Grammar in code comments and PR is important.
