# DeepLearningLibrary
Mathematical computations library designed for applications in deep learning.

## TODO
- Basic mathematical operations aside from multiplication
- Computation needs a LOT of work to accommodate different shapes
- Gradient framework
- GPU acceleration
- Unit testing
- Styling standards
